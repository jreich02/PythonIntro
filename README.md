Version(s): Pygame python <br />
- System requirements: <br />
- Have python3 and pygame installed

How to Install and Run: <br />
1.) Download the files in the github <br />
2.) Open Terminal and navigate to where you've saved the files <br />
3.) Use Terminal command: python3 pygameIntro.py <br />


Rules / How to Play : <br />
1.) Use the (left, right) arrow keys to move the player paddle <br />
2.) Don't let the pong hit the ground! <br />
3.) Try to get the highest score possible. <br />



Motivation: We wanted to create a game anyone could play to pass the time and have some quick casual fun. Settling to cerate a game based on the high-score / self-competitive modules. We created a hybrid combination of pong and racket ball. <br />
