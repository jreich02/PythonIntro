Rules / How to Play : <br />
1.) Use arrow keys to move the player paddle (left or right) <br />
2.) Don't let the pong hit the ground! <br />
3.) Try to get the highest score possible! <br />



Motivation and Reasoning: We wanted to create a game anyone could play to pass the time and have some quick casual fun. Settling to cerate a game based on the high-score / self-competitive modules. We created a hybrid combination of pong and racket ball.<br />
