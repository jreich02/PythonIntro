TODO: How to Install and Run:  <br />

Rules / How to Play : <br />
1.) Use the (left, right) arrow keys to move the player paddle <br />
2.) Don't let the pong hit the ground! <br />
3.) Try to get the highest score possible. <br />



Motivation and Reasoning: We wanted to create a game anyone could play to pass the time and have some quick casual fun. Settling to cerate a game based on the high-score / self-competitive modules. We created a hybrid combination of pong and racket ball.<br />
